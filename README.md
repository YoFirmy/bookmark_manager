## Challenge 1
The first challenge I was given was to create a user story:

```
'as a user'
'so I can quickly visit my favourite websites'
'I would like to see a list of my bookmarks'
```

I was then instructed to create a domain model from that user story:

![domain model](https://github.com/YoFirmy/bookmark_manager/blob/main/images/bookmark_manager_domain_model.png?raw=true)
